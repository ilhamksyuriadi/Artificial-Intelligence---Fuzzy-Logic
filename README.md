# Artificial Intelligence - Fuzzy Logic
Fuzzy Logic code example

-Assumption:
You already understand the concept of Fuzzy Logic and how to use it model (representation, model, and other file include on this repository)

-Given:
Given a set of data containing 30 news with two attributes: Emotion and Provocation with value 0 to 100, and the Hoax class attribute that is "Yes" and "No".
It's on News.xlsx file. Use the first twenty news, B01 to B20 as reference to building a fuzzy logic-based reasoning system (in this case, i already build it)
to detect whether ten news B21 to B30 is hoax or not.

-Goals:
Build fuzzy logic-based reasoning system and to detect B21-B30 is hoax or not

-Hint:
1. I wrote the data set manually on variable news, emotion and provoke (there are no loaded data from excel)
2. The model file (Representation, Sugeno Model, Fuzzy Rule) include on this repo for help you to figure it out what happen on this code
3. Count the result manual to make sure
4. The result (classification for B21-B30) will appear when you run the program
5. Read Guide.txt for code's guide
